We strongly encourage pull requests over creating an issue. If you have an example of a failing test, you are encouraged to submit a pull request with the failing test. See the "Development" section for more information on submitting a pull request.

If you do file an issue, please include a clear title and description of the issue and make sure to complete the full issue template. The goal of your issue should be to clearly communicate the issue and steps involved in replicating the issues.
