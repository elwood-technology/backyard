# Introduction
Backyard eases the development and deployment of microservices by providing an opinionated platform for business tool API & UI.

## Status
:warning: Not Stable :warning:

Backyard is still under heavy development. The documentation is mostly not available but constantly being written. You're welcome to try it, but expect some breaking changes. Please [report any bugs](https://github.com/elwood-technology/backyard/issues/new/choose) and [ask many questions](https://github.com/elwood-technology/backyard/discussions). [Contributions](https://github.com/elwood-technology/backyard#contributing) much appreciated!
